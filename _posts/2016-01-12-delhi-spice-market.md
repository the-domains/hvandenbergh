Chili's on the spicemarket in Old Delhi

It doesn't get more lively than on the spice market in Old Delhi. We took pictures at the wholesale market (the spice tower) where you see large quantities of chili's & spices. There are loads of shops selling spices in smaller quantities. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eeecabce-55cb-4831-beec-ca40ff72f38e.JPG)
