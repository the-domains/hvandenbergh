# 40 Maltby street

I do like the concept of this restaurant. A small, weekly changing menu on the blackboard, some great wines by the glass. No reservations, and ordering at the bar. Have eaten here a few times now, and 40 Maltby Street is definitely one of my London favourites. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/86ea211a-dd4f-4b4a-a944-c6ea8c9ef770.jpg)
