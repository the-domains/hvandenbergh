About me

Welcome to hvandenbergh.com. My name is Harry van den Bergh

This website is a collection of personal tweets, instagrams and blogposts. 

My wife and I live in The Netherlands, and we have 3 grown-up kids.

In my daily life I am alliance manager at [SUSE][0], a pioneer in open source software, looking after consultant & system integrator relationships for EMEA. 

I enjoy being part of an industry that changes constantly, and I love to see how technology innovates the way we live and do business.

I love cooking and eating good food, so be prepared for some foodpics. Coffee & tea have my special interest, having some good equipment at home, I regard myself as a home-barista.

As a fan of streetart, I try to shoot pictures of streetart wherever I go.

Although just an average runner I enjoy doing a few runs every week. 

To contact or follow me, please check my [social links][1].
